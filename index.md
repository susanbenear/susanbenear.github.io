**Hi! I'm Susan.**

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and postdoctoral researcher at New York University. My work focuses on the development of learning and memory processes across childhood and adolescence, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, as well as computational modeling.

I'm currently working in Catherine Hartley's <a href="https://www.hartleylab.org/">lab</a> at NYU investigating how reinforcement learning and episodic memory are instantiated in real-world contexts across adolescent development. I earned my Ph.D. from Temple University in 2022 under the mentorship of Nora Newcombe and Ingrid Olson, where my dissertation work focused on the neural correlates of complex event cognition and their influence on memory in young children.
