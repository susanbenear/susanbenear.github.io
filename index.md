**Hi, I'm Susan.**

I'm a developmental cognitive neuroscientist currently working as a postdoc in Dr. Catherine Hartley's <a href="https://www.hartleylab.org/">lab</a> at NYU. My research focuses on learning and memory across development, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG), as well as computational modeling. 

Formulating basic questions about how human cognition takes shape, and launching projects to investigate those questions (with the help of U.S. federal funding!) has been an immense privilege, and along the way I've developed a love for statistics and data visualization as a way to understand and communicate about the world at large.
