**Hi! I'm Susan.**

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and postdoctoral researcher at New York University. My work focuses on the development of learning and memory processes across childhood and adolescence, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, as well as computational modeling.

My expertise lies in designing creative paradigms to investigate questions of interest, and leveraging statistical analyses of both human behavioral data and simulations to draw conclusions. I enjoy both designing tasks on the front end and wrangling data on the back end, and I never tire of finding new ways to understand and visualize results.

For more information on my research, the Projects and Publications tabs above describe and link to my work. I am currently seeking a remote or hybrid research/data analyst position - please reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email.
