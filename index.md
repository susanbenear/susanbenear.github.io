**Hi, I'm Susan!**

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist currently working as a postdoc in Dr. Catherine Hartley's <a href="https://www.hartleylab.org/">lab</a> at NYU. My research focuses on learning and memory across development, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG), as well as computational modeling. Formulation basic questions about how human cognition takes shape, and launching projects to investigate those questions (with the help of federal funding!) has been an immense privilege so far, and along the way I've developed a love for statistics and data visualization as a way to understand and communicate about the world at large.

**Below is a brief summary of a few of my recent projects:**

**Exposure to novelty in the real world improves autobiographical and episodic memory in teens and adults.** In this ongoing project, we are investigating how novelty exposure in the real world influences memory in 12-25-year-olds using GPS tracking and prompting them to complete tasks on their smartphones 3 times weekly for 3 months. So far, we've found that participants have more positive memories for their own experiences on days higher in novelty, and that their memory for images in a lab-based task is protected from forgetting over time if the image was learned on a day high in novelty. We also see that memory recall and mood are influenced by mental health. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14N_-hVCA649Gkg_kNZ-1yA8pkPeGvpwH/view?usp=sharing">Benear et al., poster Aug. 2025</a>

**Neural representational patterns supporting reward-motivated memory shift across adolescence.** In this study, we examined how reward-associated memories are represented in the brain via pattern similarity analyses of fMRI data in 8-25-year-olds. We found reward information during encoding in VTC and in changes from encoding to retrieval in aHC in all participants. Adultsâ€™ memory benefitted from stability of aHC representations, while younger participants benefitted from representational drift and reward-related activation in VTA. Our findings demonstrate that reward modulates neural memory representations, and these patterns change with age. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h53qa_v2">Cohen*, Benear*, et al., pre-print</a>

**Free recall of complex events improves dramatically in early childhood and lags recognition memory.** This study was a follow-up to my previous research on event cognition, aiming to examine children's ability to freely, verbally recall complex events, such as a television episode. We found that, even in children whose event memory was quite robust according to probed measures, their free recall performance was well below that of adults. Free recall detail was often at floor for children below age 5.5 years. Verbal ability was a strong predictor of free recall, suggesting development of both mnemonic and linguistic capabilities contributes to free recall ability. <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_02221/123683/Children-s-Memory-for-Events-The-Challenge-of-Free?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Benear et al., 2024, J.
