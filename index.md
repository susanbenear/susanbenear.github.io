**Hi! I'm Susan.**

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and postdoctoral researcher at New York University. My work focuses on the development of learning and memory processes across childhood and adolescence, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, as well as computational modeling. 

Although I am an academic researcher, I am eager to translate the data science and analytic expertise I have developed in my graduate and postgraduate work to an industry setting. In my work, I design rigorous experimental paradigms and build end-to-end analytical pipelines to study complex human behavior, combining creative task design with advanced statistical modeling and simulation. I enjoy working across the full stack — from instrumenting and refining tasks on the front end to wrangling, modeling, and visualizing high-dimensional data on the back end — and I’m especially motivated by turning messy, real-world data into clear, actionable insights.

I am currently seeking a remote research analyst or data scientist position - please reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email.
