**Hi! I'm Susan.**

I'm a developmental cognitive neuroscientist currently working as a postdoc in Catherine Hartley's <a href="https://www.hartleylab.org/">lab</a> at NYU. I earned my Ph.D. from Temple University in 2022 under the mentorship of Nora Newcombe and Ingrid Olson. My research focuses on the development of learning and memory processes across childhood and adolescence, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, as well as computational modeling.
