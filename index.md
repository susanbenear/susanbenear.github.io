**Hi! I'm Susan.**

I'm a developmental cognitive neuroscientist currently working as a postdoc in Dr. Catherine Hartley's <a href="https://www.hartleylab.org/">lab</a> at NYU. I earned by Ph.D. from Temple University in 2022 under the mentorship of Drs. Nora Newcombe and Ingrid Olson. My research focuses on the development of learning and memory processes across childhood and adolescence, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG), as well as computational modeling. 

Spending my days formulating questions about how human cognition takes shape, and launching projects to investigate those questions (with the support of U.S. federal funding) has been an immense privilege, and along the way I've developed a love for data analysis and visualization as a way to query, conceptualize, and communicate about the world at large.
