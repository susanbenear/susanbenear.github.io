I grew up in Oklahoma and Texas and have lived in Pennsylvania, Spain, Tennessee, and New York. My interests outside of science include cooking and baking, running, playing piano, reading novels, singing karaoke, knitting, and dining at my favorite spots around the city with friends. My husband and I have dozens of plants and two cats named Kahlua and Fizz!
