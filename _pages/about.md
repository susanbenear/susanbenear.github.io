I am a cognitive neuroscientist who studies learning and memory from a developmental perspective. I am currently a postdoc working with Dr. Catherine Hartley at New York University. I earned my B.A. in Psychology from Penn State University and my Ph.D. in Psychology from Temple University, where I was jointly mentored by Drs. Nora Newcombe and Ingrid Olson.

My research focuses on memory and reinforcement learning across development, which I examine using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG), as well as computational modeling. I am interested in how children perceive and remember complex events, how children's memory systems prioritize generalization vs. specificity depending on contextual features, and how children and teens use memory to guide their decisions.
