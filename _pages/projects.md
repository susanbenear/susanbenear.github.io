**Here are a few projects I've been working on lately.**

**Exposure to novelty in the real world improves autobiographical and episodic memory in teens and adults.** In this ongoing project, we are investigating how novelty exposure in the real world influences memory in 12-25-year-olds using GPS tracking and prompting them to complete tasks on their smartphones 3 times weekly for 3 months. So far, we've found that participants have more positive memories for their own experiences on days higher in novelty, and that their memory for images in a lab-based task is protected from forgetting over time if the image was learned on a day high in novelty. We also see that memory recall and mood are influenced by mental health. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14N_-hVCA649Gkg_kNZ-1yA8pkPeGvpwH/view?usp=sharing">Benear et al., poster Aug. 2025</a>

**Positive valence biases in learning benefit memory specificity after a delay.** For this project, our goal was to extend prior work from our lab demonstrating that valence biases in learning are reflected in analogous biases in memory (Rosenbaum et al., 2022, *eLife*) by examining whether this same logic applied to specificity of memory, and how this changed over a delay. Rather than individual bias-aligned effects in memory, we found that participants with a more positively valenced learning bias overall had more specific memory for items associated with positive outcomes from the learning phase, but only after a 24-hour delay. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8vx3HJ4bSVkU25sBMuW8GHQEB-qN90J/view?usp=sharing">Benear, Harhen, et al., poster June 2025</a>

**Neural representational patterns supporting reward-motivated memory shift across adolescence.** In this study, we examined how reward-associated memories are represented in the brain via pattern similarity analyses of fMRI data in 8-25-year-olds. We found reward information during encoding in VTC and in changes from encoding to retrieval in aHC in all participants. Adultsâ€™ memory benefitted from stability of aHC representations, while younger participants benefitted from representational drift and reward-related activation in VTA. Our findings demonstrate that reward modulates neural memory representations, and these patterns change with age. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h53qa_v2">Cohen, Benear, et al., pre-print</a>
